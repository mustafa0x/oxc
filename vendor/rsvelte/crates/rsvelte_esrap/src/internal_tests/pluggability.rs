//! Analog of esrap's `test/pluggability.test.js`.
//!
//! esrap's `print(node, visitors)` dispatches through a `visitors[node.type]`
//! map, so a caller can register a printer for an arbitrary node type and drive
//! output via `context.write(...)`. `rsvelte_esrap` is deliberately NOT a generic
//! visitor framework: it is a specialized printer whose dispatch is a `match`
//! over concrete **oxc** node kinds (there is no synthetic `CustomType` node to
//! hand it). The extension surface that esrap's pluggable visitors are built on
//! — the [`command`]/[`context`] buffer layer — is public here, so this test
//! exercises that same mechanism: a "custom printer" pushing literal fragments
//! and flattening them, reproducing the JS test's `':) - testing 123 - (:'`.
