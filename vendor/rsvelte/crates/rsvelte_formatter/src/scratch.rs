//! Per-thread scratch arena for the throwaway oxc parses the formatter runs on
//! every `{expr}` and `<script>` body. The allocator is reset once per format
//! attempt so an attempt's parses share one arena instead of each allocating
//! (and freeing) a fresh chunk — the dominant per-parse cost once the AST work
//! is small.
//!
//! ## Soundness invariant
//!
//! [`acquire`] hands out an `&Allocator` with a caller-chosen lifetime and
//! [`reset`] takes `&mut`, so the two must never overlap. They don't:
//!
//! - Every consumer of [`acquire`] (the leaf `format_*` functions in
//!   `expression` / `script`) parses, formats, and returns an **owned**
//!   `String` / `Vec` within a single call. No arena-allocated value — the
//!   parse AST or the printed program — is stored past that call, so neither
//!   the `&Allocator` nor any reference into the arena is live once the leaf
//!   returns.
//! - [`reset`] runs only at [`crate::format_with_arenas`] entry (once per
//!   file), when no leaf is on the stack, so no [`acquire`] borrow is live.
//!   This holds for the collapse post-pass too, which re-enters
//!   `format_with_arenas` on `<pre>` bodies: by then the outer walk's parses
//!   are already consumed into owned edit strings and the collapse reflow
//!   helpers likewise return owned strings, so the re-entrant `reset` frees
//!   only already-consumed data.
//! - `SCRATCH` is a `thread_local`, so all of the above is per-thread; rayon
//!   workers never share an allocator and never race.
//!
//! There is also a compiler-enforced backstop beyond this discipline: at the
//! call sites that parse a function-local `String` (the `format!`-built
//! `wrapped` snippets), `oxc_parser::Parser::new<'a>(&'a Allocator, &'a str, …)`
//! unifies the allocator and source lifetimes, so the borrow checker clamps the
//! laundered `'a` to that local's scope.
