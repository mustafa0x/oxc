//! Repository-local instrumentation for the component slot-grouping key.
//!
//! Before the `&str`-key refactor, every non-snippet child of a component
//! fragment produced exactly one owned `String` for its slot name: either
//! `text.data.to_string()` from `determine_slot`, or `"default".to_string()`
//! from the fallback. The map took ownership of that `String`, so the count of
//! calls through this recorder is exactly the count of `String` allocations the
//! pre-refactor code performed, and `bytes` is exactly how many bytes those
//! allocations copied.
//!
//! This is a counterfactual counter: it measures work the old code would have
//! done, not allocations the process performs now (the new code performs none
//! at this site). It is compiled out unless `measure-slot-key` is enabled.
