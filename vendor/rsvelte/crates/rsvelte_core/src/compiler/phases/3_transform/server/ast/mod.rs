//! AST-based server code generation (Phase-3 rewrite).
//!
//! This is the additive, in-progress replacement for the string-surgery server
//! pipeline in [`super`]. It assembles the SSR output as a real `oxc` AST and
//! prints it ONCE with [`rsvelte_esrap::print`] — zero text processing.
//!
//! It mirrors the program-assembly shape of upstream's
//! `submodules/svelte/packages/svelte/src/compiler/phases/3-transform/server/transform-server.js`
//! (`server_component` / `server_module`). For now the template and script
//! bodies are STUBBED empty; only the program skeleton (namespace import,
//! sanitized-props / rest-props / slots prologue, and the exported component
//! function shell) is emitted. The per-node visitors live in the `visitors`
//! submodule.
//!
//! This module is NOT yet wired into `super::transform_server`; it exists so
//! the crate keeps compiling while the AST pipeline is built out.
