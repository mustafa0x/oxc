//! Lightweight thread-local timers for splitting Phase 3 (Transform) into
//! sub-phases (template fragment walk, instance-script text transform, CSS
//! render, JS codegen).
//!
//! Cost per `record()` call is one `Cell::get + add + Cell::set` — measured
//! at ~10ns per file in release builds. The `Instant::now()` / `elapsed()`
//! pair around each instrumented site dominates (~50ns × 2). Total
//! per-file instrumentation overhead is ~100–200ns, negligible against
//! Phase 3's ~60µs/file budget.
//!
//! Only the native profiling binaries read these accumulators back — the
//! compile pipeline never does, so the timers cannot affect compiler output.

use std::cell::Cell;

// `std::time::Instant::now()` traps on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (no system
// clock — see std::sys::time::unsupported). The profile instrumentation
// below is consumed only by the native profiling binaries, but the call
// sites live in shared compile paths, so the Instant calls would
// fire from the WASM playground and crash the page. Provide a WASM-safe
// shim that returns a unit "instant" with a zero-cost elapsed so the
// instrumented sites stay compile-target-portable without #[cfg] noise.
