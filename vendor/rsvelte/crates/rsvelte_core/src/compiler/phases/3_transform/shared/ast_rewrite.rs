//! Shared driver for the `*_ast.rs` collect-and-splice rewrite passes.
//!
//! Every `transform_*_ast` pass in this directory follows the same shape:
//! parse the current script in a thread-local arena, walk the AST with a
//! bespoke `Visit` collector that records `(start, end, replacement)` edits,
//! then splice those edits back into the source text (innermost-first, so a
//! later fixed-point pass can rewrite an outer node once its children are
//! settled). The *only* part that differs between passes is the collector.
//!
//! This module factors out everything else — arena take/restore, parse-error
//! bail, edit splicing, and the bounded fixed-point loop — so each pass file
//! is just its probe + collector + a few lines of wiring. The helpers are
//! intentionally small and composable rather than a single mega-driver,
//! because the passes vary along independent axes (TS vs. mjs source type,
//! `allow_return_outside_function`, single-pass vs. fixed-point, whether
//! nested edits need innermost-first deferral).

/// A pass is being rewritten from "collect edits, splice the source" to
/// "mutate the shared `Program` in place". Most of the two sides' raw output
/// differs for reasons that do not matter — the splice version returns the
/// original text with holes replaced, the in-place version is printed by esrap,
/// and esrap normalises. So equivalence is judged after putting BOTH sides
/// through esrap exactly once: `normalize(spliced) == print(mutated)`. That is
/// the property the final pipeline actually needs, because it prints the
/// mutated program with esrap too.
///
/// But normalisation is not free of consequence: it also cancels differences
/// that the *callers* of these passes can see, because a pass returns a
/// fragment that is spliced back into a larger text. So the raw bytes are
/// counted too, as their own class, and a report that gives a mismatch count
/// without the raw-diff count beside it is not a report on this migration.
